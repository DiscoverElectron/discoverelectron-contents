## Why Electron

Should you build a desktop app? Would your product benefit from any of the following?

* Having your app icon **always visible** in the user's desktop, taskbar or dock. Web apps, on the other hand, sit hidden behind one of the many browser tabs your user keeps open, which means they are easy to forget.
* Having your app icon **bounce**, or display a **badge label**, whenever there's interesting content for your user to consume. The best a web app can do is update its tiny favicon, display a notification, or (gasp) send an email.
* Registering as the **default app for certain file extensions**, so that, when your user double-clicks one of those files, your app shows up. This is not possible from a web app.
* Displaying **entries in context menus**, so that your user can right click on a file or folder and open your app. No way to do this from a web app.
* Automatically **launching your app on startup**. Again, out of reach for a web app.

However, building a desktop app using native technologies requires you to know your target platform's development environment and idiosyncrasies. If you want (or need) to put out an app that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, be ready to invest a lot of time and effort building all three versions and keeping them in sync.

If only there was a way of building desktop apps without worrying about platform fragmentation, using the web technologies you already know, and keeping the rapid development cycles you are accustomed to...

Enter <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a>, an **open-source project** created and actively maintained by GitHub. It enables you to **easily develop cross-platform desktop apps** using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while also providing access to rich native APIs.

These companies (and many others) are already building their products using Electron:

## Questions

<div class="columns columns--questions">

* ***Which package should I buy?***

  Obviously the *Complete Edition* is the one that provides the most value, but, if your budget is tight, the *Basic Edition* still gives you the information you need to build professional desktop apps with Electron.

* ***What if I'm not an experienced developer?***

  Don't fret, the book holds your hand every step of the way. If you know a little bit of JavaScript, you'll be able to follow along just fine.

* ***What version of Electron is used?***

  The apps developed in the book are built using the latest version **0.31.0**.

* ***Will you provide updates?***

  Of course! Buying the book entitles you to the current version and to all future updates.

* ***What if I hate the book?***

  If you hate the book, I don't want your money. Just reply to your purchase receipt email within 30 days and I will issue a refund.

* ***You didn't answer my question.***

Hey, I'm Daniel Perez Alvarez. I've been a professional sofware developer for over 9 years, and I'm currently working for Microsoft.

I'm really excited about Electron and the possibilities it brings, so I wrote this book to share everything I know about it with you. I hope you get a ton of value from reading **Discover Electron**!
